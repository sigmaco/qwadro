# The Qwadro Execution Ecosystem
Qwadro is a name for a family of standards specifying ***software engineering infrastructures*** designed by the SIGMA Technology Group that defines the interface between an operating system and application software. The primary goal of Qwadro is to ensure that applications written for one Qwadro-compliant system can be easily ported to another, regardless of the underlying hardware or specific operating system implementation. This portability is achieved by standardizing the interfaces, utilities, and libraries that applications use to interact with the operating system. Qwadro provides a common ground, fostering interoperability and reducing the complexities associated with platform-specific development. Adherence to Qwadro standards simplifies software development, maintenance, and deployment across diverse platform environments.

The main design force behind Qwadro is to fix the main problem with POSIX. While POSIX is intended to specify how operating system must be made, Qwadro aims to standardize middleware development and deployment by providing unified architectures for APIs, specifically bridging low-level C17 APIs and abstracting them across various platforms. This can make it easier to build and deploy software on different operating systems without worrying too much about platform-specific intricacies.

Qwadro is data-driven and designed to handle distributed, federated systems. Instead of focusing solely on individual devices or local systems, it facilitates an interconnected system where data and tasks can be managed across multiple nodes or services, making it a potential backbone for cloud-based, edge computing, or distributed systems. The term federated execution expresses a collaborative execution model, where components work together in a decentralized or distributed way, which could be beneficial for large-scale applications requiring high scalability and flexibility.

Middleware typically helps applications communicate and manage resources without needing to interact directly with the OS. Qwadro offers a middleware layer that abstracts system software, providing standardized services, APIs, drivers, and libraries to improve performance and accelerate development. This is ideal for industries and use cases that require both high performance and platform portability, such as simulation, interactive entertainment, and multimedia (e.g., gaming, AR/VR, video processing).

Qwadro is not a single framework like Qt; it's an ecosystem of modular middleware components, each designed to handle specific platform aspects (e.g., graphics, shell, file systems). These middleware layers can be easily swapped or replaced after compilation, allowing for dynamic updates or customizations. So, by design, Qwadro Execution Ecosystem is a amalgamation of software infrastructures intended to offer a set of acceleration building blocks to edify system softwares targeting firstly computer simulation, interactive entertainment and multimedia user experience. Qwadro constitutes a unified infrastructure of and for middlewares, libraries, drivers and engines, continuously integrated, providing resources, devices, services and abstracting operating systems and platforms in a straightforwared uniform way. It is released as open source under the Qwadro License.
